# Huffman Coding & Entropy Calculation

This project implements Huffman coding for text compression and calculates the entropy of a given string to analyze encoding efficiency.

## Features
- Compute character frequencies  
- Calculate entropy using probability distribution  
- Build an optimal Huffman tree  
- Generate Huffman codes  
- Encode & decode text  
- Measure average bits per character
